# PrayerAssist

This application is used to manage prayer requests, manage bible studies, groups, and act as a central hub for communicating these kinds of things out to a group. It is the front end for the PrayerAssist API. For now, the API is a private repo that I am working on scaling out, but demo videos of the app will be coming soon!

PrayerAssist leverages LLMs, fine-tuned models, and a variety of other systems that I have built out to help automate the process of managing people's prayer requests and bible studies. This is something I'm pretty passionate about, as I've led my share of bible studies!

I built a prototype with the first front-end using React while leading a group. I found this to be quite helpful, and have been working out the kinks and transitioning to mobile app development.

An older prototype giving a general idea of the app can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUhxGmyXxlc).
